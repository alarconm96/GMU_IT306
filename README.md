# GMU_IT306
Various assignments and projects I did for my IT 306 Data Structures & Algorithms in Java class at George Mason University. After graduating in May of 2022, I am no longer adding to this repo. This is merely to showcase what I did for that class.

## Course Outcomes
* Understanding of fundamental data structures, abstract data types, algorithms and the tradeoffs between different implementations of these abstractions.
* Analyzing the runtime efficiency of algorithms that create and manipulate data structures.
* Implement and use learned data structures to solve real computing problems. This includes substantial reinforcement of language-specific techniques for abstract data types and design and debugging techniques.
* Assessing how the choice of data structures and algorithm design methods impacts the performance of programs.
* Solving problems using data structures such as linear lists, stacks, queuees, hash tables, binary trees, heaps, tournament trees, binary search trees, and graphs and writing programs for these solutions.
* Solving problems using algorithm design methods such as greedy method, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, and writing programs for these solutions.
